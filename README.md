This was a 2-man project which we had in our second year in the second semester. The purpose was to build an Android application, so we chose to recreate the classic Asteroids game. Due to time constraints, we did not get to finish the full game with highscores and power-ups as planned originally, but the current version of the game works with a main menu, video playback, full sound effects, asteroid destruction and collisions, 8-bit themed background music, an interactive thumb-controlled joystick for movement and 2 buttons for controlling thrust and firing. The core game is written using only native Java for all calculations with no external APIs.
